# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The example leverages the Iris dataset for illustration but can be adapted for various datasets with similar features.

## Features of the Script

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loads the dataset.
   - Displays basic information and checks for missing values.
   - Standardizes selected features for clustering.

2. **Elbow Method**:
   - Calculates inertia values for a range of cluster numbers.
   - Visualizes the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

3. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Performs clustering with the optimal number of clusters.
   - Assigns cluster labels to each data point in the dataset.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Visualizes the clusters using the first two features.
   - Highlights cluster centroids.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or above
- Libraries: Install the required Python packages using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
  ```

---

## Dataset

This script uses the Iris dataset from Seaborn's data repository as an example. You can replace it with your dataset by updating the `dataset_url` variable or providing a local file path.

Example:
```python
dataset_url = "path/to/your/local/data.csv"
```

---

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python customer_segmentation.py
   ```

3. Replace the dataset or adjust the script to fit your use case as needed.

## Output

- **Initial Dataset Details**:
  Displays dataset statistics and missing values.
  
- **Elbow Method Plot**:
  Helps determine the optimal number of clusters.

- **Cluster Visualization**:
  Displays customer segments with cluster centroids.

- **Clustered Dataset**:
  Outputs the first five rows of the dataset with cluster labels.

## Notes

- Ensure the features used for clustering are numeric.
- Modify the features used for clustering in the script:
  ```python
  features = df[['column1', 'column2', 'column3']]
  ```
- Update the number of clusters based on the Elbow Method plot:
  ```python
  optimal_k = <your_optimal_k>
  ```
